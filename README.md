# Java Distributed Systems

This reposetory is an upload of code I would on a few years back before I used git. The code is supposed to be seen as entierly depricated. And likely will not crash somewhere. For this reason the project will therefore be licenced as "_WTFPL_" (What the Fuck You Want to Public License)

This is a small file Server in Java with a clinet and a (objiously) Server, you can create, modify and delete Accounts and procces some data like the amount of "Coins" the account has.
